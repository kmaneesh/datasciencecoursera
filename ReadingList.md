* Doing Data Science (Cathy O'Neil & Rachel Schutt, O'Reilly press)

    ```
    It is based on Columbia University's introduction to data science class, and covers really everything your book covers and everything I mentioned above but with less "and this is how we do it in R".  It is also much more specific about real world applications - recommendation engines, fraud detection, data journalism, data engineering, even competitions.  It does all of this in only about 350 pages.

* Data Scientists at Work (Sebastian Guiterrez, Apress)

    ```
    It is essentially a bunch of case studies and interviews of famous data scientists, describing their day, what they look for in people they hire, how they arrived at doing data science.  It's a fun read but maybe not structured enough for a class textbook.

* Statistics Done Wrong (Alex Reinhart, no starch press) 

    ```
    It is a really important work on how badly a lot of science today is being damaged by the fact that there is no money to reproduce results, "null" reports are never reported because they aren't "interesting" and because a lot of researchers don't understand why it is wrong to do things like re-use your training data as results data.  It's a small book, less than 150 pages, well worth a read.
